## Student Brief:

This week you will need create a content page for the website, you must select a food that would be classified as ‘unhealthy’ per our previous class discussions. You should research and propose an alternative that other students could use. You must present your findings and give an analysis of the results.

## Student Entry:

In our previous class discussions we said that fast food was unhealthy due to the high amount of salts, sugar and fat. There is usually a low amount of fibre and protein. We all agreed that pizza would be an ideal example to show other students in the school. We all eat pizza a lot after matches and it would be good if we could find a better version.

### Results of the pizza poll are below:

Below is a breakdown of the Dominos nutrition in their Pepperoni Pizza. Many of our class would eat this pizza as it was voted class favourite.

We will focus on the Medium size pizza for our analysis as it is the most comparable in size to the alternative we have made.

We research online for different recipes of making pizza and we discovered it can take quite a long time to make the dough. We settled on a recipe and ventured to our local Tesco to buy ingredients. With the permission of the Home Economics teacher and supervision we were allowed to make the pizza after school over two days. Below is the details of the recipe so other students can now make it. This recipe gave us enough for seven pizzas.

The next step is to assemble and cook the pizza

1. Remove the dough and the sauce from the fridge.
2. Turn on the oven to 200 Degrees to preheat.
3. Using a floured surface, gently use your finger tips to push the dough outwards from the centre.
4. Rotate the dough frequently and continue until the dough is approximately 0.5 cm thick. It can be slightly thicker around the edge.
5. Spread three tablespoons of sauce with the back of the spoon.
